Author statement
Please note that the information and opinions presented within this white paper are entirely the opinions of its author, they are not presented as fact in any way.
The purpose of this document is to present a theory, a concept of how a system could be created.
Abstract
In this white paper, I intend to outline an idea to fund, track and prove a person's education and achievements throughout their lifetime, such a mechanism would have massively beneficial primary attributes to an individual and some surprising secondary attributes to individuals, parents and the educational system in general.
I intend to show how educational accreditation of achievement is often lost in unprovable filing systems, are of no real value to the achiever (the citizen) and can be lied about at will.
The suggested approach could also provide a method of paying for a citizen's education, future and prosperity. And resulting in an asset of both financial and academic in nature.
Protecting identity whilst remaining resistant to subversion, hijacking and other acts of poor intent.
I also intend to illustrate how such a mechanism could aid in the early detection of conditions such as autism, behavioural disabilities, higher-level talent etc


Why is this needed
Educational stagnation
In the 1900s, a non-human powered vehicle was a horse-drawn carriage; in today's society, it's motor vehicles that can drive themselves, packed full of technology,  barely recognisable from its ancestral counterpart.
The same can be said for personal communications, the latest mobile phone technology bears little resemblance to the antique rotary phones of old.
Such comparisons and evolutionary leaps can be drawn of most industries, topics and methods.
The classroom, conversely, has changed very little in 100 years and, although methods, reviews and examinations have changed many times, attitudes and certifications have remained the same.
A citizen's achievements is a throw-away piece of paper, an accolade held primarily in the filing systems of the awarding bodies.
Certifications, examination results, awards, praises and even degrees and doctorates remain difficult to confirm save for a piece of paper awarded to the achiever.
Real-world achievements and accolades, such as written word, pieces of art, exercises of mind etc are going unrecognised and their attribution is being falsely made.
Parental path requires inaction
From the moment a child is born, the educational system demands that a parent wait, understandably. But when a child does start their educational journey, they do so in relative isolation from their parents. 
It would be impossible to report on the achievements, accolades and merits a child makes during a school day. Their termnal, bi termnal and seasonal reports can only be succinct and general in nature; lost in a sea of averaging as a result of the many student classroom models.
That being said, there are many, seemingly, vital data points that are not being captured, reported and attended to at all. Ostensible putting the child's progress, safety and future at risk.
An inexhaustible list of other valuable data-points to collect might be
Food and nutrition
Sleep
Exercise
Perceived behaviour
Perceived happiness
Acts of kindness, malice, etc
Incidents
Ablutions
Behavioural corrections
Illness
Absence/attendance
Travel
Whereabouts
Accreditations
Custody
No single record
Every time a person or child moves between educational institutions and activities. The record of achievement is started anew. It is not common practice to share such records, they are by no means added to and are, therefore, difficult - if not impossible - to aggregate and useless as an asset to the child.
Child individuality lost
Educators, coaches and mentors that care and provide tutoring to many children at the same time are, understandably, restricted to using generics and greater good methods to teach, care for and track children. This makes it difficult to cater to individuals in any way.
Creativity, excellence and aptitudes can be missed and, even when detected, can rarely be nurtured effectively.
Educational guidelines
It is understood that there exists, no firm rules as to how a child should be educated. Instead, there are guidelines that an educator can choose to follow, or not.

Real-world achievements and accolades
Previously, a person's neighbourhood was limited to the street in which they live, their social and academic circles limited to a small community.
Today, technologies are removing those boundaries, the next Einstein-like brain could well be in a backwater town in a previously inaccessible area. Similarly, a truly exceptional mind could be going largely missed due to poverty, ignorance or other limiting factors.
Many times, in history, great works have gone missed during an individual’s lifetime, and then can often be falsely attributed to the wrong individuals.
An individual would have no real way of conclusively proving themselves as originators of works should they need to.

Note: It is worth noting that the word “Achievement” in this white paper can apply to any or all of the following;
Lineal steps of achievement in courses, learning activities etc
Events
Created works
Intellectual achievement or creations
Physical creations or creations (that can be represented in digital)
Accreditations
Items of merit
Praise
Nutritional and fitness goals
Events in health
etc

The suggested solution
Citizen asset
A safe, provable, decentralised ledger of achievement that can only reflect the achievements of a subject and allowing a mechanism to prove an individual is said subject.
Noteworthy secondary benefits
Inheritable asset (financial) - via proof of life mechanism
Asset (proof in academia)
Educational funding mechanism
Universal educational standards
Educational rules
Lesson plan marketplace
Accredited actors
Benefactorial contribution

Distributed ledger
A little about Distributed ledger and some of the relevant functions available
Smart contracts
DLT (distributed ledger technology, has afforded us with a mechanism to execute contracts in a digital fashion with little or no human interaction. Such items are moved from one state to another in a transactional manner, executing as they do, a procedure contained within itself. By virtue of this mechanism, it is possible to follow the entire journey of the smart contract, verifying it as we do.
This can be compared in simple terms, as a sort of If-this-then-that function with its own, incotrifutable, audit trail.
A smart contract can be owned by a wallet, multiple wallets or by no wallets at all. Depending on the instructions stored within itself
Wallet, payment and savings mechanism
Another mechanism afforded to us by virtue of DLT is wallet and digital money storage.
A smart contract is interacted with by accounts known as wallets.
A smart contract is, itself, a wallet.
A wallet is a location to store currency.
Currency can be paid into a smart contract, or to a wallet that can be controlled by a smart contract and paid out from a smart contract.
Proof of life inheritance
Proof of life (not to be confused with a DLT ‘proof’) is a mechanism that allows ownership of a smart contract or a wallet attached to a smart contract to be passed over to another user should the original owner (in our case, a parent) fail to prove their life in an adequate fashion.

Suggested approach
Creation of a smart contract, I am calling the “Record of Achievement Smart Contract” (RoaSc)
The contract would act as an intermediary contract that allows actors (witnesses) to submit evidence of a child’s progress in a meaningful way.
Evidence can be attributed to an established lesson or course plan.
Evidence can be of any nature, [see list of possible data points in the “Parental path requires inaction” section of this document]

RoaSc creation and interaction
In the first instance, several tools would be created that could interact with the RoaSc in a meaningful, simple way.
Interfaces, websites and applications that allow anyone to interact with the RoaSc in their own particular niches or industry.
There would exist a master contract that is responsible for the creation and setup of RoaSc contracts. A small gas fee would be required to run it, and any remaining currency could be used to further development/profit etc.
I.e. nursery classroom management apps, private instruction or accreditation etc
Suggested interfaces:
Block browser - A user could use a browser that allows them to see the transactional timeline in a meaningful way and for any contracts they are involved with
Witness Browser/app - an app that allows user to submit testimony to any contract to which they are connected
The subject, or owner, of the RoaSc could cryptographically sign messages proving that they are the subject or owner of the RoaSc
As intimated previously in this white paper. We are suggesting that, upon a child's birth, a parent would create a RoaSc from their personal wallet. From then on, the RoaSc would recognise them as the coordinator/owner of the contract.
Also, an individual could create a RoaSc for themselves to begin a proveable history of achievements
A rough instructional road map might go like this
Coordinator creates a wallet.
This wallet would, hitherto, be used to send instructions to the RoaSc
Coordinator uses a wallet to create a RoaSc, sending a small gas fee in the request
Coordinator can optionally create a wallet for a child and instruct the RoaSc to accept the child's wallet as the subject 
Coordinator (or any authorised benefactor) can optionally start making regular payments to the RoaSc for the child’s future
Participating witnesses (educational bodies etc) each create a wallet
Coordinator instructs RoaSc to accept witness and add it to their list of authorised contributors
Witness uses their wallet to submit evidence to RoaSc
Coordinator rents can instruct RoaSc to send funds to a witness, only, if they have submitted evidence to the contract
RoaSc uses its own, internal, logic to accept or deny evidence provided
Child uses their wallet to cryptographically sign a message proving that they are the subject of the RoaSc
Coordinator, given certain parameters provided at creation time, can hand over ownership to the child at any point by sending instructions to RoaSc
Coordinator can send a “proof of life” instruction to RoaSc
Coordinator can send a transfer to contract instruction to RoaSc
RoaSc can enact its inheritance clause on a certain date
Evidence the RoaSc could track?
Achievements academic in nature
As evidence submitted to the RoaSc can be attributed to bona fide lesson and course plans, there becomes a need for lesson plans to be created, checked and accepted.
Such plans, however, do not necessarily have to be of an academic nature.
A lesson can consist of anything from Native language, numeracy and literacy to instruments, skilled activities and even hobbies.
A parent, wishing to teach their children to play the piano - for instance - can instruct their RoaSc to accept a private piano teacher as a contributing witness. 
The piano teacher, following a universally accepted or accredited lesson plan, can contribute evidence based on their own credentials.
Real-world achievements, works and accolades
In today’s technological age, it is possible to create a digital representation of a piece of art, written work, even physical items like houses, cars etc
If an asset can be digitised, it can be entered into an RoaSc as an achievement
My RoaSc, for example, could contain an achievement of this white paper.
I could then prove provenance as the author and creator of the concept.
Personally identifiable and confidential information 
All information, by virtue of Distributed ledger technology, is encrypted.
Information submitted would be done so against a wallet address, in order to prove that an individual is a subject linked to the asset, they would sign a message in a way that only they can.
Until that point, no connection is ever made with an individual unless publicly released by the subject.
Until a suitable age, all information would be private in nature and released to individuals by the owner of the RoaSc specifically.
The age of consent as a milestone, or an age in which it is generally accepted and understood that a child understands and is responsible for the events and achievements store within an RoaSc.
As DLT is a ‘push’ technology, there would be absolutely no need to store any personally identifiable information as all in a RoaSc
Third-party systems utilising the RoaSc would do so in a testimonial sense and those systems would hold and be responsible for PID (personally identifiable Data)
For example, a nursery would register a child on their own system, that system would store name, DOB, parent contact details etc, and the child’s RoaSc address.
Actors
Subject (child)
Coordinator/Owner (parent)
Witnesses
Tutors, nannies, teachers, nurseries, schools, clubs, accreditation bodies
Authors
Bodies authoring lesson plans
Benefactors
Family members or charitable entities wishing to contribute to a child's future. Benefactors can contribute to an RoaSc based on rules specified upon creation.
Contributing witness accreditation?
Anyone can create and be the subject of a RoaSc.
Any persons following a lesson plan and undertaking tests, examinations and assessments with an accredited witness, can progress to any status required.
Any person creating a digitally representable asset can testify of its creation.
Lesson plans, plan marketplace and accreditation
As evidence submitted to the RoaSc can be attributed to bona fide lesson and course plans, there becomes a need for lesson plans to be created, checked and accepted.
A lesson can consist of anything from Native language, numeracy and literacy to instruments, skilled activities and even hobbies.
To become accredited, an individual can create and fund an RoaSc themselves, and then undergo plans and courses.

Smart contract as a funding and savings mechanism
By virtue of Distributed Ledger Technology, and in order to interact with DLT based smart contracts a user must own a compatible wallet.
A smart contract can also control wallets in the same architecture.
This means that a user can send currency to the RoaSc that can be controlled by the contract.
The contract can then fund events in the child’s life, college courses, improvement activities etc
Any remaining funds in the smart contract can be inherited by the child at predetermined stages of their lives or as a result of a failed “proof of life”
It is also worth noting that any benefactor can also contribute to the child's wallet, family members, organisations, friends, etc

More about Proof of life inheritance
At creation time the creator of an RoaSc could specify a period of time in which Proof of life should be made and a proof-of-life policy.

Proof-of-life policy can be changed at any point by the owner.
If that period of time has passed without interaction from the owner, then ownership of the contract and it’s wallet can be moved to the subject or another nominated account, depending on the Proof-of-life policy.
A proof of life policy might be; 
Example 1 ...
If an owner does not interact with the RoaSc within 1 month, ownership passes straight to the child

Example 2 ...
b) If the owner does not interact with the RoaSc within 6 months, ownership passes to the next of kin specified


Machine learning, Out-of-the-ordinary and autistic detection
It is possible to apply machine learning and AI algorithms to a RoaSc’s transactional history. 
Such technologies could potentially identify and notify rapid or out-of-the-ordinary changes in a subject’s record. Data points could contribute to an automated suspicion.
Such data points could easily be used to identify characteristics on the autistic spectrum, learning difficulties but also above average talent and abilities.
Note: These examples are quite contrived, but they are meant to demonstrate that, given certain data points, and diagnostic algorithms, conclusions could be reasonably deduced.
Example 1 …
Timmy is a happy child, then on the 11th Oct, his perceived mood switched to sad and has not yet consistently returned to happy.
Automated suspicion: Timmy is not happy with a change in his circumstances that happened on or around the 11th Oct. 
Example 2 …
Sandra is happy most of the time, then at 1200 on a Wednesday and after she ate rice pudding (after lunch), her perceived behaviour changes from compliant to aggressive.
Automated Suspicion: Sandra might have a slight intolerance to rice pudding and that it manifests in aggression.
Example 3 …
Pauline is a compliant young girl, after every lunch that consists of bread or pizza, she becomes distant and sluggish.
Automated suspicion: Pauline may have an intolerance to gluten
Example 4 …
Each morning, Angelina is distant and does not engage, she has always seemed happy and compliant, but since the 24th of this month, she has seemed distant and withdrawn. Teacher noted in uncharacteristic understanding of a topic adult in nature
Automated suspicion: Angelina is being abused.
Example 5 …
Mrs Smith, a teacher at busy bees nursery is entering, on average, 33% less data points than her counterparts
Automated suspicion: Mrs Smith is not doing as she should 

Use cases

Use case 1. Nurseries

A nursery is charged with caring for the safety of a child, introducing them to academic surroundings, the concept of an academic day and some basic skills like Numeracy, literacy etc

A parent will drop their child off but are essentially cut off from them.

With RoaSc,
A parent can;
assign a nursery as a witness to a child's RoaSc
The nursery is then able to interact with the child's RoaSc, storing key points
Reading and literacy key points
Nutrition
Sleep
Location
Ablutions
Attendance
Incidents
Etc
the parent is then able to keep abreast of the child's progress and well being throughout the day
The parent is able to pay the nursery for the child's attendance rights via the RoaSc

A Nursery can;
Engage their children’s parents in a unique and meaningful way
Get paid for any and all relating services
Track the wellbeing and general behaviour of their children
Leverage certified child progress and lesson plans
Vet and certify their staff

A Nursery Teacher can;
Track a child's progress to maintain their progress
Interact with nurseries and parents seamlessly


Use case 2. Schools
A school is charged with progressing a student through a predefined academic syllabus, a student is regularly tested and graded. A students progress is stored in an internal filing system and reported periodically in a progress report.
Progress reports are often generic with listed grades.
With RoaSc, 
A parent can;
assign a school as a witness to a student's RoaSc
The school is then able to interact with the student's RoaSc, storing key points
Examination and test results
Fitness
Extra curriculum achievements
Creative achievements
Perceived behaviour
Perceived mood
Attendance
the parent is then able to keep abreast of the students's progress and well being throughout the day
The parent is able to pay the nursery for the child's attendance rights via the RoaSc

A Nursery can;
Engage their children’s parents in a unique and meaningful way
Get paid for any and all relating services
Track the wellbeing and general behaviour of their children
Leverage certified child progress and lesson plans
Vet and certify their staff

A Nursery Teacher can;
Track a child's progress to maintain their progress
Interact with nurseries and parents seamlessly
A student can;
View their own progress
See behavioural insights
Challenge themselves

Caveats and obstacles not yet considered
Byzantine fault tolerance
Selection of 
Taxation and other theft resistance
No research or opinion has been undertaken or created on this subject
Accreditation chicken and egg
And launch time, a number of accreditation agencies would be required to get on board quickly in order to be able to award accreditations early on
Bad actor mitigation
Much of this could be achieved by virtue of the DLT system chosen
However, this should be considered at design time
Gas cost
A master contract would be created that is responsible for deploying, setting up and assigning RoaSc’s this master contract could require a fixed fee from the sender in order to pay for the initial gas cost.
Then on, the owner would accept responsibility for gas costs in order to operate it.
Gas costs would be minimal!
Performance issues
There would not be much need for performance per sei. Achievements could take days to enter into a selected DLT with no ill effects
Emancipation
As a matter of this white paper, I have not addressed the issue of emancipation, this could be controlled by the owner of the RoaSc in a different manner. I would not allow any interference, whatsoever, of any governmental or authoritative agency.
Update and ongoing development
Unlike many immutable smart contracts, transfer of functionality could be passed to newer iterations of the contracts if desired.
A master contract would be used to deploy new contracts. This contract would automatically deploy new versions of the RoaSc.
